This repository has the code required by Elo7 for the recruiting process. You can find the problem description [here](https://gist.github.com/elo7-developer/1a40c96a5d062b69f02c).

## Dependencies
* Python 3.7.0
* virtualenv not required

## Install
* run `python main.py`

## To-do list:
The code is not finished yet, and there are many improvements that will be done:
* Remove #comments;
* Remove verification prints;
* Finish adapting the code to work with multiple probes (the code already works with 1 single probe); <OK>
* Clean function `main`, create functions in the code and work with it properly; <OK>
* Adapt the code to be an API.
